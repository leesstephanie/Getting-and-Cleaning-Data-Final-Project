## How the script works

The script `run_analysis.R` should be in the same directory as the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" to make this script generate the desired data set. For example:

```
setwd("R/ds3/FinalProject")
```

As we can see, the working directory would be "Final Project". This working directory would have the script run_analysis.R and the dataset directory UCI HAR Dataset. Check out CodeBook.md for more information on the dataset.

Check CodeBook.md for more information on the transforming the data set. Detail instructions on getting the tidy data set has also been included in the script. Each step is followed by the code.
